## Who's this for?

Did you independently produce a film or series, with a budget of about $3M to $10M? You finished production, set up buyer screenings, look for sales agent and distribution?

Then this information is for you.

## What is Filmhub?

Filmhub is the alternative to the traditional film distribution industry. Filmhub takes the entire distribution process online.


## What are the problems of the traditional distribution industry?


For independent producers, to finance, produce, promote and distribute your film/show you used to rely on industry practices like foreign presales and gap financing. 

## How is Filmhub different?

## Why Filmhub now?

Video streaming is causing a massive paradigm shift. Discovery and viewing habits radically are changing.

But our film industry is virtually unchanged. There's unlimited shelf space, a cheap digital path to the audience - but producers still face the same gatekeepers, agents, distributors and other middle men. 

There's little value and need for the old middle men. Digital streaming and marketing creates a level playing field, and Filmhub as the platform gives  control back into the producers.
